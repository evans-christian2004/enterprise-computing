# Enterprise Computing projects

---

These are all the projects and assigments I'm doing in my Enterprise Computing class. I'm taking this opportunity to get better at writing java applications.

## Project 1: Nile.com
This projects is to basically create a storefront that allows the user to search items in a CSV file given with an item ID, name, price, etc.

### Concepts that I need to learn for the projects:
- GUIs with Java standard lib
- File IO
- multithreading
- object oriented programming overall because I didn't actually make anything in my object oriented programming class (thanks college education)
